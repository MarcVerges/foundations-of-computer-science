# Foundations-of-computer-science

**Basic programming principles and C++ syntax learned in introductory computing courses.**

---

This repository contains foundational exercises and notes from the course *Fundamentals of Computer Science*, focused on basic programming logic using C++.  
It includes examples covering data types, operators, conditional structures, loops, functions, arrays, and introductory object-oriented features.  
The materials were developed as part of a first-year university course aimed at building solid programming habits and understanding core computational principles.  
Special attention was given to clean code, structured problem solving, and modular program design.  
This repository reflects the early development of my programming skills, growing in complexity from week to week.  
The exercises are clearly documented and may serve as a reference for other students beginning their journey in computer science.
